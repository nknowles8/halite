Strategies

    1. Attack nearby enemies
        - 4p game vs 2p game
            - 4p game we might want to avoid confrontation
        - Intercept rather than fly straight towards

    2. Split the game into different phases and have a strategy for each
        - Without having watched many games, my feeling is:
            a. Fleet building
            b. Confrontation
            c. Consolidation

    3. Probabilistic choice of planet to fly to to avoid congestion
        - Higher probability for nearby planets and large planets
        - Planets in our area vs in the middle vs other areas

    4. Collision avoidance/pathfinding

    5. Travelling in packs
        - Travelling in packs to spread damage received and to quickly destroy
          enemies

    6. Specialised drones
        - Give each drone a job

    7. Destroy planets
        - Does it make sense?
            - maybe when winning or when planet is docked by many of enemy
        - Target any planet that is fully docked by enemy?

    8. Track how many/which bots are going where and take that into consideration when delegating

    9. Damaged ships to become kamikazes or focus on docking -- related to (6)
